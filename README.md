## üßë‚Äçüíª II. Application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
### üîπ How OOP Enhances KAAGAPAY
-II. Explanation of How OOP Principles Were Applied

Encapsulation: 
Encapsulation is central to the system‚Äôs architecture, ensuring that data is safeguarded and tightly integrated with its corresponding functionality. Each module is logically grouped into packages such as Db, Entities, Manager, UI, and Main. Sensitive attributes like username and donationAmount are declared private to prevent unauthorized access. Access to these attributes is strictly controlled using getter and setter methods, enabling validation and ensuring proper handling of data. Encapsulation also enhances modularity, making the system easier to maintain, debug, and extend.
Inheritance:The base class User contains common attributes such as username and password.
Derived classes like Volunteer extend User, adding specific attributes like assignedMission.

Polymorphism:
Method Overriding: Subclasses redefine inherited methods to implement specific behaviors. For instance, the toString method in the Volunteer and Donation classes provides tailored string representations for these objects.
Enums: Enumerations, such as mission statuses (ONGOING, COMPLETED), encapsulate predefined constants, ensuring type safety, readability, and extensibility. These enums enable the system to adapt dynamically to various use cases while maintaining clarity and consistency in code.

Inheritance
The project uses inheritance to streamline shared functionality and promote code reuse. The User class acts as a base class, encapsulating common attributes such as username and password. Subclasses like Volunteer extend User and introduce specialized attributes and behaviors, such as assignedMission and isApprovedForMission. This design not only eliminates redundancy but also ensures that shared logic can be updated in one place and inherited across related entities, improving the overall maintainability and scalability of the system.

Abstract/Interface
I utilized the ConsoleDesign interface to define a structured and consistent framework for managing console aesthetics. This interface specifies methods for tasks such as clearing the screen, changing text colors, blinking text, and displaying logos. By employing the ConsoleDesignImpl class to implement the interface, I ensure that all console-related operations are centralized and reusable. The interface abstraction allows me to maintain platform independence, as implementation details like screen clearing commands or color codes are encapsulated within the implementing class. This design fosters scalability, as additional methods or effects can be introduced without altering the interface users. By leveraging interfaces, I effectively decouple the console's design logic from the application's core functionality, promoting modularity, easier maintenance, and enhanced flexibility in adapting to new design requirements.
